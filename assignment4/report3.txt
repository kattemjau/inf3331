Test of numpy implemetasion
a=0
b=1
n=4000000
f(x)=x**2

You see here that numpy is 0.012 seconds faster then the standard python implemetasion

integral constant = 0.8492166996002197
integral linerer = 1.0292816162109375
integral numpy = 1.016557216644287
numpy raskere:  0.01272439956665039
integral numba = 1.3110735416412354

testing was done without the plotting of the graph
